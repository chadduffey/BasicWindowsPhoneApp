BasicWindowsPhoneApp
===========

This application was used to learn how to publish apps to the windows store.

It is a very basic application that reads an rss feed from a blog. (http://blogs.technet.com/chadduffey)

It was published to store, although i recently removed it because it really isnt very useful.
